# To delete photos from your iPhone using your MacBook without importing it first,use **Image Capture**

## Steps:

1. **Connect Your iPhone to Your MacBook**:
   - Use a USB cable to connect your iPhone to your MacBook.
   - Unlock your iPhone and select "Trust This Computer" if prompted.

2. **Open Image Capture**:
   - Open **Image Capture** from your Applications folder or by searching for it in Spotlight (`Cmd + Space` → Type "Image Capture" → Enter).

3. **Select Your iPhone**:
   - In Image Capture, select your iPhone from the list of devices on the left-hand sidebar.

4. **View and Select Photos**:
   - You'll see thumbnails of all the photos on your iPhone. Select the photos you want to delete by clicking on them. Use `Cmd` to select multiple photos or `Cmd + A` to select all.

5. **Delete Photos**:
   - Click the **Delete** button (usually a small circular icon with a slash through it) at the bottom of the Image Capture window.
   - Confirm the deletion.

### Notes:
- If you don't see the **Delete** option, ensure that your photos are not synced via iCloud. To check:
  - On your iPhone: Go to **Settings > Photos** and ensure "iCloud Photos" is turned off.

Unfortunately, most open-source apps won't directly access and delete iPhone photos due to Apple's restrictions. However, **Image Capture** is efficient and does not require additional downloads.
