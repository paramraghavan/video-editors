# video editing
- iMovie, this avaialble on macbook, ipad, iphone.
- CapCut (https://www.capcut.com/editor) and upload your video. Free, easy, and powerful editing (no watermark if logged in). I used my google account login, I was able to edit my video for free. I had to use this as **capcut allows you to custom zoom into to you video clips.**
