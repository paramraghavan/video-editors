- PAD and HPF Switches under microphone
The four mono input channels have PAD and HPF switches. Turning the PAD switch on will attenuate the sound input to the unit. This is typically not needed when a microphone is used for vocals. The HPF (High Pass Filter) switch will apply a high-pass filter that attenuates frequencies below 80Hz. This can be useful when speaking into the microphone to help reduce wind sound and vibration.
