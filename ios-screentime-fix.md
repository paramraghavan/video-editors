1. Turn off screen time for the device that is needing to be blocked for downtime (childs device)
2. Make sure all pictures have synced with iCloud or they will be lost (scroll to bottom of photos app to check if any pending) sign out of iCloud on all devices that can either approve screen time requests or have screen time limitations (child and parents)
3. reset the same devices (not erase content, just reset all settings by going to settings > transfer or reset iPhone > reset > reset all settings)
4. sign back in to iCloud on all devices
5. turn screen time back on and set downtime limits
6. everything should be working normally now and stay as is
