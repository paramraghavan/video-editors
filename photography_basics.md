## What is ISO, Aperture and Shutter speed
- here is a short and crip video  from David Manning detailing  all the above,  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7z7BAZdt2M
- ISO Number
  - 100 outside bright an sunny
  - 200 in the shade
  - 400 inside
  - Higher number when it's dark, but as the number goes up the pitcure will be grainy
  - Depending on the camera sensor quality/sensitivy you can go with igher iso number without getting grainy pitcure at a relativly higher iso number
- Here is a picture explaining Aperture and field of depth
